# homework_fall2019
Modified Berkeley's cs285 (Deep Reinforcement Learning).

A big limitation for independent learners of cs285 is its dependence on quite expencive MuJoCo engine.
This repo contains modified homeworks which use Roboschool instead of MuJoCo.
The tasks will be updated over time.

Combined https://github.com/berkeleydeeprlcourse/homework_fall2019 and https://github.com/rbahumi/homework/tree/hm1_roboschool
